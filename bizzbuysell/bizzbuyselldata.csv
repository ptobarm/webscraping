Already healthcare agencies are absolutely crucial to facilities lacking much needed staff. This trend will only continue considering the average age of the RN population. The average age of the RN population in March 2000 was estimated to be 45.2 years. In 2000, only 31.7% reported being under the age of 40. The most significant drop in numbers was seen among those RNs under the age of 35. In 1980, 40.5% of RNs were under the age of 35, compared to 18.3 percent in 2000. The RN population under 30 dropped from an estimated 25.1% in 1980 to only 9.1% in 2000 According to CNN, the baby boomers stand on the threshold of a big change. The oldest of them are nearing their 65th birthdays and their needs and wants are in flux. Their purchases will begin to revolve more around health care and housing than on rock and roll and athletic gear. **************************************************** Why is there a boom in the service area?--- Beyond elder care. An increasing number of the elderly couples and singles are living fulfilling lives on their own. As they age, however, they will require more and more services to help them deal with day-to-day living. Some of the most successful franchise businesses of the next few years will be ones that will provide cost-efficient services, both medical and non-medical, for the aging population of the United States. According to the U.S. census, between the years of 2000-2010, the population between the ages of 18-44 is decreasing 1%. The population between the ages of 45-54 is increasing 21%. However, the population of ages between 55-64 is increasing at 47%. People between the ages of 44-65 are the “New Customer Majority.” Their market is 45% larger than the 18-43 market and will be over 60% larger by 2010. According to David Wolfe and Robert Snyder in Ageless Marketing, “The New Customer Majority is the only adult market with realistic prospects for significant sales growth in dozens of product lines for thousands of companies.” **************************************************** The senior Care Environment--- Long-term Care Demand and Our Aging Population The market for long-term care is rapidly increasing which will increase the demand for our services in nursing homes, hospitals and private duty assignments. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the elderly population (persons 65 years old and over) increased eleven-fold between 1900 and 1994; the non-elderly increased only threefold. Under the Census Bureau's middle series projections, the number of persons 65 years old and over would more than double by the middle of this century to 80 million (up from 33 million in 1994). By the year 2030, about 1 in 5 Americans will be elderly. The oldest old is the fastest growing segment of the elderly population. The oldest old (persons 85 years old and over) are a small but rapidly growing group, comprising just over 1% of the American population in 1994. From 1960 to 1994, this group increased 274% to 3.5 million, compared with an increase of 100% for persons 65 years old and over, and an increase of 45% for the total population. Overall, the oldest old were projected to be the fastest growing part of the elderly population as we entered this century and beyond. By 2020, the U.S. population over the age of 65 is projected to grow to 55 million while the population over the age of 85 is projected to increase by four times to over 13 million. As age increases, the need for long-term care also increases. **************************************************** Shortage of Nurses--- There is an acute shortage in the United States of registered nurses. A recent study published by the American Hospital Association states that the average age of a nurse is 45 years old and that less than 10% of all nurses are under the age of 30. This coupled with the dynamics of an aging population and increased government requirements for staffing at hospitals and nursing homes have created a substantial demand for our services. We believe that competition for qualified personnel will continue to increase and that our benefits and methods of ""sharing the success"" with our employees will make us an attractive employer in the marketplace and allow us to be the most attractive answer when individuals are looking for employment. **************************************************** Why Would Nurses Become Contract Workers Instead of Full-time Employees?--- Many nurses are switching from demanding shift positions in traditional settings to contract staffing. For a comparable salary and benefits, an employee has more flexibility and control over their schedule, vacations and holidays and less risk. Some nurses enjoy doing a variety of jobs in which they can use many of their skills and others prefer to use one specialty, contract work allows these options. **************************************************** Professional Licensure and Corporate Practice--- Nurses and other healthcare professionals employed by us are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law and we will check with the state to ensure each license is valid and has no disciplinary action against it. Our comprehensive compliance program will be designed to ensure that all employees possess all necessary licenses and certifications and comply with all applicable state laws."|Retirement from industry.
